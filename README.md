<b>Telegram April contest 2019. (1 week)</b> 
(March contest - https://github.com/opiumfive/android_chart_stage1)

Goal is to show simple charts with 5 bonuses (I did only last):
1. A line chart with 2 lines, exactly like in Stage 1
2. A line chart with 2 lines and 2 Y axes
3. A stacked bar chart with 7 data types
4. A daily bar chart with single data type
5. A percentage stacked area chart with 6 data types
Bonus goal: A percentage stacked area chart with 6 data types that zooms into a pie chart with average values for the selected period

"When selecting the winners of Stage 2, we will consider speed, attention to detail and functionality. "

<b>Some notes additional to part 1:</b> 
- still on canvas;
- reworked y animations;
- optimized performance by bitmap caching;
- for area to pie chart transition "canvas.drawBitmapMesh()" function used, btw not well documented;
- optimized for landscape mode
- apk size 120kb
